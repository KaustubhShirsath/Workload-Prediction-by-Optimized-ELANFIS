# Knowledge workers mental workload prediction using optimized ELANFIS

• The competitive society in the new era calls for more research to improve the well-being of workers as
well as to improve their productivity. Knowledge workers face a high mental workload in terms of
planning and coordination. One solution is to predict the mental workload of knowledge workers.

• This study aims to optimize the extreme learning adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ELANFIS) by
integrating particle swarm optimization into a micro genetic algorithm to predict the mental workload
of knowledge workers. Although the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) shows reasonable
prediction performance, it also suffers from the curse of dimensionality and has a poor computation
time.

• Two types of data were used for this study. One was data collected through questionnaires issued to
the participants to assess their subjective experience of the task load (NASATLX) in terms of mental
requirements, their emotions, and their stress levels, and the other type was data collected through
sensors, for example, “computer interactions, via a computer logging tool; facial expressions, via a
webcam; body postures, via a Kinect 3D camera; and physiology (ECG and skin conductance), via body
sensors.

# Proposed model to predict mental workload
• In the above method, the advantages of both, Particle
swarm optimization and a micro-genetic algorithm are
combined into one. When the two algorithms are
integrated, the resulting algorithm can locate promising
areas of the search space and find better solutions at a
faster rate. This is Modified Micro Genetic
algorithm(MmGA). 

• The results of this study show that the optimization of
ELANFIS using the proposed MmGA produces far better
performance than that of ELANFIS without optimization,
with improvements in the MSE and RMSE for regression,
and even surpasses the optimization of ELANFIS achieved
using PSO alone.
